Shiny Dashboard for Accident Data Analysis


Overview
This Shiny Dashboard is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing the accident data. It offers a user-friendly interface for exploring accident-related information, making data-driven decisions, and gaining insights from the data. The dashboard is equipped with interactive components, allowing users to customize their analysis based on specific criteria.

Features
Data Upload: Users can upload their own accident data or use the default dataset provided (in this case, "new.csv").
