Shiny Logo

Overview
This Shiny Dashboard is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, specifically designed for analyzing accident data. It offers a user-friendly interface for exploring accident-related information, making data-driven decisions, and gaining insights from the dataset. The dashboard is equipped with interactive components, allowing users to customize their analysis based on specific criteria.

Features
Data Upload: Users can upload their own accident data or use the default dataset provided (in this case, "new.csv").

Filter by Number of Injured Persons: A slider enables users to filter accidents based on the number of injured persons, helping to focus on severe accidents.

Select Hour of the Day: Users can analyze accidents occurring at a specific hour of the day using a slider.

Death Victim Type: A dropdown menu allows users to select the victim type for analyzing fatalities among motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists.

Injured Victim Type: Similar to death victim type, this dropdown helps users analyze the injuries sustained by motorists, pedestrians, or cyclists.

Street Map: Displays accident locations on an interactive map with customizable markers. Users can explore accident details by clicking on the markers.

Histogram: Visualizes the data using interactive histograms.

Top Risky Streets: A table displaying streets with the highest number of injuries or deaths, depending on the selected victim type.

Top Fatal Streets: Provides insights into streets with the highest number of fatalities based on the chosen victim type.

Vehicle Type in Accidents: Shows the distribution of vehicle types involved in accidents.

Causes of Accidents: A bar chart representing the top contributing factors for vehicle accidents.

Data Overview: A table presenting the raw data, allowing users to explore the dataset.

Hourly Map: Offers an interactive map view specifically tailored to the selected hour.
